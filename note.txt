npm install @types/express --save-dev
npm install -D @types/express @types/node





The -D flag in npm install stands for --save-dev, which means you are installing the package as a development dependency.
What does that mean?

Development dependencies are packages needed only during development, not in production.
Examples: TypeScript, linters, testing frameworks, build tools.
They go under "devDependencies" in your package.json.


 1. TypeScript is a development-time tool

TypeScript adds static type checking and compile-time safety.
It helps developers catch errors before running the code.
But browsers and Node.js cannot execute TypeScript directly — they only understand JavaScript.

✅ 2. Production runs compiled JavaScript

When you build your app (tsc), TypeScript compiles .ts files into .js.
The compiled JavaScript is what actually runs in production.
So, the TypeScript compiler (typescript package) is only needed during development/build.

✅ 3. Why keep it as devDependency?

In production, you typically deploy the dist/ folder (compiled JS), not the source .ts files.
Keeping TypeScript as a dev dependency reduces the size of your production environment and avoids unnecessary packages.


When would you need TypeScript in production?

If you compile on the fly (e.g., using ts-node in production), then you need TypeScript installed.
This is rare because it adds overhead and is not recommended for performance reasons.





ts-node-
ts-node is a tool that allows you to run TypeScript files directly in Node.js without compiling them to JavaScript first.
✅ What does it do?

Normally, Node.js only understands JavaScript.
With ts-node, you can execute .ts files as if they were .js files.
It uses the TypeScript compiler internally to transpile code on the fly.


✅ Why use ts-node?

Faster development: No need to run tsc every time you make changes.
Great for scripts, quick testing, and development environments.
